    Displays this text.

  -b <use book?>
    Toggles usage of opening book on/off (default 1).

  -e <echo?>
    Toggles screen output on/off (default 1).

  -g <game file>

  -h <bits in hash key>
    Size of hash table is 2^{this value} (default 18).

  -l <black depth> [<black exact depth> <black WLD depth>]
     <white depth> [<white exact depth> <white WLD depth>]
    Sets the search depth. If <black depth> or <white depth> are set to 0, a
    human player is assumed. In this case the other parameters must be omitted.
    <* exact depth> specify the number of moves before the (at move 60) when
    the exact game-theoretical value is calculated. <* WLD depth> are used
    analogously for the calculation of Win/Loss/Draw.

  -p <display principal variation?>
    Toggles output of principal variation on/off (default 1).

  -r <use randomization?>
    Toggles randomization on/off (default 1)

  -t <number of levels> <(first) depth> ... <(last) wld depth>

  -time <black time> <black increment> <white time> <white increment>
    Tournament mode; the format for the players is as above.

  -w <wait?>
    Toggles wait between moves on/off (default 0).

  -learn <depth> <cutoff>
    Learn the game with <depth> deviations up to <cutoff> empty.

  -slack <disks>
    Zebra's opening randomness is <disks> disks (default 0.250000).

  -dev <low> <high> <bonus>
    Give deviations before move <high> a <bonus> disk bonus but
    don't give any extra bonus for deviations before move <low>.

  -log <file name>
    Append all game results to the specified file.

  -private
    Treats all draws as losses for both sides.

  -public
    No tweaking of draw scores.

  -keepdraw
    Book draws are counted as draws.

  -draw2black
    Book draws scored as 32-31 for black.

  -draw2white
    Book draws scored as 32-31 for white.

  -draw2none
    Book draws scored as 32-31 for the opponent.

  -test
    Only evaluate one position, then exit.

  -seq <move sequence>
    Forces the game to start with a predefined move sequence;
    e.g. f4d6c3.

  -seqfile <filename
    Specifies a file from which move sequences are read.

  -thor <game count>
    Look for each position in the Thor database; list the first <game count>.

  -script <script file> <output file>
    Solves all positions in script file for exact score.

  -wld <only solve WLD?>
    Toggles WLD only solve on/off (default 0).

  -analyze
    Used in conjunction with -seq; all positions are analyzed.
  -repeat <#iterations>
    Repeats the operation the specified number of times.
